    <div id = results> During our performance, the participants caught on quicker than anticipated. <br>
    This meant that the end result was more cohesive than we initially thought it would be. For the origami in the second trial,
    many stopped trying and this did result in an extremely varied final product as intended.  </div>
    <div id = documentationTextWrapper>The element of chance is the choice that you make at the beginning and the result of the choice that you made. How did your origami end up looking? How did you perform your dance? Was there a certain arm you preferred moving first, and where? 

       <br><br> The performance is done by the audience. When presented with two choices without context, what will they do?
        
       <br><br> The audio recorded instructions give them a fixed time to complete every step. There is no going back.
