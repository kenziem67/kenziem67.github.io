        <h1>Week Two - Ulises Carrio패n</h1>
        <p>In the reading. Carri칩n describes mail art as a form of two parts (making the piece and posting it). He claims that you have control
            over what is made and how it is made, but lose this control once it is posted (mail regulations, stamps, weighting, etc). Carri칩n also
            describes the Big Monster that is present in this form of art and though he says he doesn't know what this monster is, my first 
            thought when doing this reading was that it was the regulatory presence of the postal system. <br><br>
            Q1. How has the concept of "mail art" shifted or expanded recently/with the pervasive digital age?<br>
            Q2. On page 40, he says "The relationship between the two sub-systems [written or visual language and postal services] is permanent 
            but not rigid." and describes that when a romantic partner sends something, the primary thought is the fact it was sent not the contents 
            of the letter, but when a bank sends something, the emphasis is on the text. Do you agree with this claim or do you think this 
            perspective may have changed since this was written?<br></p>

        <h1>Week Three - Laurel Schwulst & E패douard U</h1>
        <p>This reading describes how websites function as living pieces of art. By comparing websites to a series of things (both living and 
            non living but adaptable) they arrive to the point that websites are an open ended and incredibly versatile form. There is constant
            work to be done in evolving and modifying them to represent the goal and the designer themself. I really enjoyed this perspective 
            and the comparisons the authors drew. I find it to be a motivating view point on website design. <br><br>
            Q1. what function does the formatting and addition of images serve for this paper?<br> 
            Q2. Did you find any one of the companions particularly appealing or suitable? <br></p>

        <h1>Week Four - Olia Lialina</h1>
        <p>In this reading, Lialina examines the demise of Geocities by searching through the archives and reporting the findings. She uses 
            these old internet relics to show the impacts of dead websites and how time and deletion destructs these once well equipped 
            platforms. The aging nature (and the examination of it) brings to question how to preserve content, media, and art that is put on 
            the web and how aging impacts the web like it does anything else. <br><br>
            Q1. Is it possible that cultural moments naturally lend themselves to being more or less preservable? Are personal websites and 
            portfolios more "safe" than mass or public platforms from specifically the sort of aging written about here? <br>   
            Q2. How do you view the methods of archiving and digital retention morphing as time goes on? Is there meaningful value behind 
            copying everything or maintaining physical copies? Do you see a way for this matter to be resolved through progress or do you 
            believe that task to be futile?<br></p>
        <!-- reading response four -->
        <h1>Week Five - David Reinfurt</h1>
        <p>This reading largely focused on human perception, psychology, and how we see things. They talk about this in the context of design 
            and how it can be used graphics to the designer's advantage and to add complexity and interest. These human characteristics and 
            trends are invaluable to designers as it enhances both the effect and utility of designs.<br><br>
            Also, I am currently in introduction to cognitive science, and it was interesting seeing the crossover and intersections between 
            what was covered in this reading and what we discuss in that class. We have had many discussions on the modularity of perception 
            versus cognition and how that impacts the way we see, think about, judge, and perceive things. We used some of the exact same 
            illusions as brought to our attention in this reading to facilitate our discussions as well (two faces, lines are the same length...). <br><br>
            Q1. On page 8, it's discussed that some psychologists claim that the whole ("a new, distinct, dynamic, and inseparable whole") is 
            in fact not a sum of its parts and is in fact a completely separate thing. What are your thoughts on this from both a cognitive 
            perspective as well as a design/artistic one?    <br>      
            Q2. Logos, marketing, and branding are some of the focus towards the end of this reading, but in what other contexts do these same ideas prove 
            useful and important? Should they be considered as strongly when creating more personal art?<br></p>

        <h1>Week Six - Alessandro Ludovico & Florian Cramer</h1>
        <p>In this reading, Ludovico discusses how the rise of digital publishing and change in attitude surrounding print material. He 
            references how print is becoming increasingly a sign of "collectors' items" and a rarity. This is something I have always found 
            interesting. I think it's very interesting that we seem to place a higher value on a design when its physical even if the exact 
            same image is digitized as well (a phone wallpaper vs a print on your wall at home, for example). Ludovico explains this transition
            through DIY books and zines from the 90s and activism through the print form versus the digital form. He describes that despite 
            the roots in print media digital publishing has the benefits of networking and has the potential to transform the prior processes. 
            He also suggests as the print media gets higher value associations and print become more gradually the norm, there could be a 
            merging of the two forms.<br><br>
            Q1. In the afterword, Cramer begins with discussion of the term "post digital." Where do you believe we fall now, how do you think 
            we could describe the change in tech/the digital age and society's relationship?<br>
            Q2. How to you view print vs digital media differently in your day to day life. Do you place higher value on what you own physically,
            or do you see them the same or even the other way?<br></p>

        <h1>Week Eight - Bojana Coklyat & Shannon Finnegan</h1>
        <p>I enjoyed this break down of alt-text. In my limited experience I have found rather direct and, for lack of a better word, plain 
            alt text. This is normally something like literally describing the contents of an image. I don't think there's something necessarily
            incorrect about this, but the approach of treating it like "poetry" with more text painting is intriguing. I have never had to 
            rely on alt text, so I can not speak on the contrasting experiences, but while these literal descriptions are effective at 
            describing the contents of the image, more poetic descriptions can capture the mood/tone/feeling that is created by the presence 
            of that image. <br><br>
            Q1. In the context where there is both alt text and a caption or other form of description, how "crucial" is it to vary those 
            descriptions and how should they work together or be disjoint?           <br>
            Q2. If there isn't one correct way to write these alt text poems, how should universal (or as close to universal as possible) 
            understanding be accomplished? Should it be strived for?<br></p>

        <h1>Week Nine - Ramsey Nasser</h1>
        <p>This reading discussed on something I had wondered for a while and I was glad to read something formally about it. Since my first 
            exposure to computer programming (java), I was curious as to how (or even if) the language translated. Reading this perspective 
            about how it actually isn't and instead English tends to dominate computer science (in at least some aspects) was disappointing, 
            though not necessarily surprising. I am curious as to how or if a universal neutral/unique language could come to be. I know that 
            the course AP computer science principles for high school allows the course to be taught in any language a teacher seems fit then 
            the exam is pseudo code analysis. I wonder if something similar in principle could be adapted but beyond pseudocode. <br><br>
            Q1. When thinking about a "universal" spoken or signed language for day to day, it would be likely impossible for one to exist due 
            to cultural and practical differences between the lives lived and expressions or use of words. Do you think this same problem is 
            present in programming or do you think the confines of the machine removes this challenge?<br>           
            Q2. Do you see any merit in the argument that the language is not important because everyone still has to learn the syntax regardless 
            of their linguist background? I have heard people say that even though the key words and commands are in English, even English speakers 
            have to learn them so it isn't that much of a difference, but I am inclined to disagree. As the author references, something like the If, 
            then, else.. relationship is much more easy to learn/understand if you speak English an use the words if and then regular<br> </p>

        <h1>Week Ten - Ben Duvall</h1>
        <p>In New Modernisms, Duvall is discussing the development of graphics and their signing roles as times and primary signaling spaces 
            are changing themselves. Duvall then uses the example of Disney/mickey mouse iconography and their slightly pervasive nature to 
            show how their alteration or lack there of is a testament to the signing role of Disney symbols as well as the critique that can 
            be implied in breaking a known and accepted graphic or icon. <br><br>
            Q1. Whenever I read something about either trends or developments of a norm over time I tend to ask myself "why shape" is this 
            process. Do you envision the development of signing and graphics as a circle that will go around and cycle through itself over 
            time, a line of continuous change, a wave like pattern, or anything else?<br>
            Q2. I think it is interesting to look at things that have become so universal that they have strayed near entirely from their 
            meaning. For example, in an early lecture of my class I found myself curious about the origins of the bluetooth symbol. Do you 
            think/how do these developments lower accessibility for new users<br></p>

        <h1>Week Thirteen - Paul Soulellis</h1>
        <p>I liked this reading and the idea of a "post" as a performance and how the digital age is shaping this. I was particularly 
            interested in the portion about live streams and constant surveillance. It is something that has only grown since this was 
            published in 2017. It is remarkable how it seems that nearly every conversation and moment is recorded and uploaded somewhere. 
            It feels like half of the content you see online is an interaction that would never have been filmed or seen by millions ten years ago. 
            It raises a lot of interesting questions about performance as this reading discusses such as are we now always performing or how 
            does the potential of being filmed shape our interactions. <br><br>
            Q1. Do you believe there is a way to make a publication online that is 100% authentic and reflective of yourself in a vacuum?<br>
            Q2. How, if at all, does the presence of recording and videotaping affect your day to day actions?<br></p>

        <h1>Week Fourteen - Neta Bomani & Sabii Borno</h1>
        <p>"Beyond Dark Matter" is a story of a young computer/software engineering student who, at the beginning, is focusing most of her 
            energy on her work at the computer. When she wakes up to find herself "inside" her software update The Way, she is faced with the 
            truth that much of the foundations of computer science and engineering are built upon harmful power dynamics, oppression, and 
            false narratives. This comes from misattribution, insensitive naming, and selective history. She throws herself out of The Way and 
            discovers The Beyond where she is encouraged to break from the oppressive standards of computing and focus energy into change and 
            community. She comes from this experience viewing her work as a computer scientist in a new way and reenters her relationships with 
            some restored vitality. I found this to be a moving and important story. I think it is important for anyone pursing computer 
            science or engineering in any capacity to acknowledge the problematic elements of the fields origin, or at least taught origins. 
            The simple narrative structure of this story made it accessible to a wide range of audiences with I appreciate from this type of 
            thing.<br><br> 
            Q1: What are ways in day to day programming that these built in biases and harm can be checked and reduced?<br>
            Q2: As mentioned in the story there are many elements of a computer's history and the history of computer science that are either 
            overtly rooted in oppression, or that have been altered to fit a "more appealing" narrative to those who are writing the history 
            text books. This complicates the idea of a "hero" or "pioneer" for computer science. Do you find that there is still a productive 
            way to talk about these figures?<br></p>
